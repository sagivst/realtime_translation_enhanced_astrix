Denitsa_Dencheva_00002.wav|Hi, DZ. How are you? Hello, I'm fine, I'm good morning. I'm very good. I'm having my sense of ease. It's not a pleasant surprise. You are online waiting for me. That makes me... Yeah, I just... I just... I just... I want to do the admin. Yes, wonderful. Yeah, I just... You are so successful. Yeah, my system always notifies me when a client is online, because they might need my assistance. So you created your personal trading account. This is the place where you can login whenever you have a free time whenever you want, David. And you can pay it. So if you deposit this 3.5, you'll be able to use it to buy and sell gold, petrol, Amazon shares, many different products. Which means that every day you have the chance to make a little bit of money for you and your family. On top of your salary. I'll give you a small, small example just so you can understand. If you had started, let's say, yesterday with the 3.5, in just one day you had the chance to make 5,000-run profit with the gold. In just a day? Yes. Which is fantastic, am I right? You're right. So it will be how much... How much am I going to lose because of that? The minimum is 3.5, David. That you can... 3.5. Yes. Oh, what do you say... I asked you to say 400. No, I've never said 400. Maybe you might have... Yes, okay. Those are some price. No, no, 400. No, no. Yesterday we were discussing and I told you that you're making very little money. And I wasn't sure if you can afford this 3.5. You understand? Yes. Yes. Just say it like this. No, I'm surprised that you're saying it's 1.5. No, what? I'm pretty sure you heard me the first time, never mind. Can you manage to put 3.5 tomorrow? Are you able to afford it? Tomorrow. Yes. Maybe a month or two. Because the money I get is almost dead. It's just one thing. I get so many people. Yes. They're paying you every week or every two weeks. Yes. Every month, it's on 27. On 27 you're getting it. Okay, but you're going to get 4.8, right? Yes. Okay. That means you're going to be left with 1,000 for the rest of the month. Can you cover the expenses, the food, with that money? No, I'm going to... I will try my luck. So maybe if I want... I will... Then it's a good thing. But if I lost... Okay, I understand. Because you're making so little, David, what we're going to do is the following. When you put the money, the 3.5 in, I'm going to assign an account manager, whose job will be to teach you how to manage the risk, meaning how to maximize your profits, and minimize the losses. And also, I'm going to activate a special benefit for you. It's called protected positions. So that you can at least give it the try. You can pay it 5 times without any risk of losing money. So you can really understand whether you like it or not, whether it's for you or not. You understand? Yes, I understand. If you think it's too risky, just withdraw your money back after those 5 trades. Oh, okay, yeah. Now I'm not saying. Yeah. At least you can try it. You can try it without the risk. And see how it goes. See if you can make some money. Even a thousand rand is good for you in this situation. And then you can decide, David, if you want to continue. But the truth is, I was thinking about you after we spoke yesterday, you really need another source of income. That means taking some sort of risk. Am I right? Yeah, you are right. Because you can't get another job, the second job. You need to sleep at the end of the day. So that is one of your options. Now, which bank are you going to use, David, to make the... Yeah, I'm going to use an SNB. SNB, wonderful. So let's do it like this. We'll keep in touch. There are two, how many weeks until three weeks I think. Three weeks, maybe two. Not two weeks. Two weeks. Well, the 20th is that you're getting paid when the 25th? 27 weeks. 27 weeks. Okay, it's two weeks and a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Can you say the one is on the Monday? It's on the Monday. It's on Monday. Yes. No, then I will get it Friday. The Friday is... Before that. Ah, okay, okay. That means that 24th. 24th. Yes. Yes. Oh, if it's 24th, then it's 24th. Yes. Oh, if it's 24th, then it's 24th. Yeah. Oh, if it's 24th, then it's 24th. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, if it's 24th, then it can be... Then that means I will get it on 28th. Ah. And then that time on Monday is 27th, right? Yes. Then I will get it on 27th. On the 27th, okay. Yeah, of course. I can get it before the 25th. Ah, I understand. No problem. Keep in touch. I'll call you next week so we can talk more about the market. And when the time comes, just think about it. Make a financial plan because obviously you really need to make more money. I really need to make more money. And then... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... It's... Okay, thank you. Are you at work? No, I'm going home now. Ah, did you do the night shift? No, I'm going back to the bus. You're in there too. Ah, okay, okay. All right, all right, David. So I'll call you next week if you need me in the meantime. Send me an email. And I'll call you back. Okay. All right. I have a wonderful day, David. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.

Denitsa_Dencheva_00004.wav|Hello. Hi, I'm Nia Maseekin Teben. It's your name's Vicky. My name is Vynis. I'm calling my interconnection with requests about trading online to make you extra money for yourself. Yes, I'm listening. Yes, have you traded before? No, I haven't. But I'm quite interested in the lot of ads or in your face advertisements that I wanted. Yes, I know what you're saying. I would say so. Sometimes you don't even, you're just reading something or you want to just skip it and then you click on it. But yeah, I would like to know, I would like to know more of it. But I'm very, I would like to research things, doesn't matter what it comes down to. So I think my email address I did give. So if any information, most of the information that is there website, then I can research and read them to try to understand what every company is offering in terms of your service. Let me explain something. What you registered for, even without wanting to, even though it's not the case because you have to put all your details. So you register with us is to trade on Forex, which is the largest financial market in the world. As much as I would like to account for all the information and knowledge in an email, it's not possible. What I've just done is the attention of email with information about the company. How are you going to use this? That's what I've just addressed. That is actually what I was, I mean, so I'm always going there trying to look at, you know, I've lost, I've tried this before. I was, I was, I'll be honest with you, I was scanned out of money. Very, very difficult when it comes to these things. You know, it's easy to be taken today. Yes, yes, yes. It's a fight that we've been fighting for six years. You can imagine how bad it is for us. The legitimate companies that are putting it forward again and again, I mean, that's how markets in terms of worlds, you know, excess. Very much open by the thing is this, you know, that openness and excess that we have is almost six of the things of the different countries. We, we're getting in contact with people that's not even in the same continent as you. That's the problem. So, so the thing, the problem with, with that for me is, is those scams, these people that doing these things, I mean, that irritates the amount of money. Makes it just difficult for us to, you can imagine how much irritates companies like ours that comply by South African law and we still have to deal with whatever these guys are doing. Because honestly speaking, the problem is that the government also doesn't really want to fight them. I'm not sure why or what are the reasons. The only way you can be sure that you are protected by law in South Africa even is if the company is licensed by the FSA, this means that you are protected by law. If anything happens, while you're trading with our company, you can always go to the FSA file complaint and if there was something done wrongly to you, you can get your money back. Whereas, with companies overseas, nobody can help you because they're not in the country, they're not liable or in the country. Because it was now, I don't know which company you actually calling from, but I think our regulation advertisement on that. Something came up with it and for me it's just simple. If the company is based inside the regional, just based for the, if there is local access point, in other words, a branch or a number or somebody, you know, I can speak or talk to. That also, you have, it's all been for me. I've got a check that goes in here. There's a friend, goes in here. There's a friend, goes in here. And check it out here. Check out the check out. And I'm supposed to be close over there. Yes, there, but I, it's not, you know, I'll check my room. You're probably at work now. So just hit why when you receive it on our website, you can see all the regulation information. No, no, no, that is, that is what it comes down to because I understand where I'm sitting. I like to, I'm like now on the gym at work. So I'm the one, when I have the time, I've got, I've got, I haven't looked and I start looking around and reading and going through what I need to do to ever look at them. So it's nice that you send me that is a website, the link is in here. I'm just saying thank you. I'll take with you tomorrow. I would love also to show you how, how we can help you as a company to, to be a good trader and to make money. Because that's the, the goal here. No, no problem. All right. Have a wonderful day at work. Again, I need you to need me. Bye-bye. Okay, thank you.
Denitsa_Dencheva_00005.wav|Thanks. I really liked the language. Hello. Yes, yes, we can do it. Nice to meet you, my name is Denise. I'm calling you on behalf of FHGNZA, the online trading company. I see that you really want to make some money online by trading. Yeah, I do. Wonderful. I'm calling you to help start. Thank you. So have you done it before trading? Yes. Okay, did you like it? Ah, very much. Come again, I can hardly hear you. Yes, very much, you know. You like it very much. Wonderful, my friend. That means you managed to make some money, right? Yeah, true. How old are you? You sound really young. Yeah, true. I'm going to. Oh, I wish I was 21. I'm 46 and Kiso. Life is going very fast. Are you a student? Are you working? No, I'm working. Already working. Okay, my friend. Now, how much do you want to invest with our company to start trading? So how much is minimum? It's 3.5. Ah, minimum is 5. 3.5. Can you afford that much? Yeah, but I don't think you can just month. Maybe the end of the month. How much do you make it work at your job? Ah, above the minimum. Yeah, but I mean, if you're making something like 4 or 4.5, this is almost your entire salary. I'm sure you know that on the market nobody can guarantee that you will only be making profits. There will be losses as well. You know that, right? Yeah, I know it. Because it's very important for me not to put in here all your money. And then you're going to need to buy clothes, to pay transport, to take your girlfriend out or whatever. Yeah, I get you. So tell me, what more do you want to learn about trading? How we can help you as a company? I... To be honest, trading is my thing. You want to take full time? Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. That's wonderful. Okay. You know with our company, a NotioriCis on the website, when you invest this 3.5, you will be assigned a personal account manager. Meaning you'll have a professional teaching you different risk management strategies, giving you signals, which will help you get better and better with trading, being interested and being confident. You didn't have that before, right? Yes. Were you trading alone before? Yeah, alone. That is the thing alone. Oh, I see. That's not easy to do it on your own. Because you have nobody, even if you're making a mistake here in there, nobody is there to correct it. To tell you what we're doing, right? Oh, my God. That means you're very smart. If you're many, do you know your own? What is the biggest profit you've made so far? About sometimes 50, about, yeah. 50,000? That's wonderful. And how much did you invest to make this 5K? 1K. 1K. So you made 5 times your profit in how long did it take? I like, I may really trade any profit, placing today and gaining today. You're a day trader, that's wonderful. But the job that you're doing is it's part time. No, permanent. Futa, how do you manage to trade during the day? Aren't you going to get in trouble with your boss? Nah, I get the day of the day. Ah, ah, I see. During the weekdays. Ah, ah, I see. And what is your job? What do you do? I, it's a restaurant work. Oh my friend, that's not an easy job. Yeah, that's why I'm focusing on trading. On trading? Yeah, because it's much nicer to trade at home or your car's at the ball, you don't have to deal with clients, you know? With bosses. You are your own boss. Are you a chef or, or, or you wait the tables? But do you do that? I'm working at the kitchen. In the kitchen? Okay, what do you do there? The kitchen? Of course, these wash-in dishes, croquis, income, time, yeah. Oh my god. That's not an easy job, my friend. You deserve to be making at least 20,000 in a month, honestly, for what you're doing. Because I hate doing this on between you and me. That's my worst. That's why the day I got a dishwasher, I was so happy of telling you. That was the best day of my life. Okay. So I don't know, maybe you can dig my number and, and one telling me when you're saying... Yeah, I mean, if you're sure that when do you get paid usually? I own the, did she, or the two ones, yeah. I mean, the last day of the month. Yeah, at the end. Okay, so you got paid two weeks ago and the money's gone. It's been the toll. Hi, if you were, that's why I'm focusing. Yeah, but the point is how much are you gonna get at the end of this month, October? Above four days. Oh, no, no, that's out of the question, my friend. You can't put your entire salary in this. That means you're gonna be left with 500 grand. How would you want to survive for a month? It's 500 grand. I get problem is I like trading. That's your problem. No, I understand why you want to succeed. And I admire people like you know, young people you are different from us. Because we were taught by our parents, find the job, find the facilities, they told down, you know. They were asked for more. But your generation, you are smart. You want to work for yourself. You want to find more money, more opportunities. I really like that. But you also have to be practical, thank you. You know that, right? So I'm sending you my email and I'm gonna send you an SMS with our WhatsApp number of the company. I'm gonna ask your favor. As soon as you get your salary, if you think that you can put this 3.5, you can get back to me. But honestly it's much better to start saving money on the site. Until you get to 3.5. Yes. All right. Do you want me to check with you next week or just wait for your WhatsApp? Okay, for WhatsApp. Send me a WhatsApp. All right. Take care, thank you so much. I have an S.B. Bye.

Denitsa_Dencheva_00007.wav|Hello. Hello. Hi, Ben. How are you? I'm alright. Wonderful to hear is Denise Collinio from FXGMZP. Yes, Denise. Yeah? Yeah, we spoke yesterday. Did you receive my email? Yes, I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. Okay. I did. I did. Oh, okay. I'm actually thinking of your app. What is your app's name again? Excite. Excite. Yeah. I'm just like a login or... You like it? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just busy with that thing. Okay. That's wonderful. Are you happy with the information that you saw, Ben? Does he look comfortable working with us? Yeah, you see what the other, you know, it's maybe something I used to get used to or because for me, I hear people saying, yeah, you spend so little time, I think for me, when I look at all of this, understanding or knowing when to put your order in in terms of all of them. Exactly. That's very important. There's a lot of research and things I still need to go through to make to understand as a function of it, you know, or what. Let me explain even how regulated legitimate companies work or how our company works. Basically, when you invest with us, even if it's a minimum of $200, you are assigned a personal account manager, who's job is to teach you how to predict the market, how to know when to enter or exit, meaning how to open or close a trade. He's going to teach you risk management because that's the most important thing you need to learn. How much capital to use, not to expose yourself too much on the market because it's quite volatile, especially now. And his job is to give you all the necessary information so you can become confident and independent in your decisions. Is that all you're looking for? No, no, no. It has just, I'm actually just on the app now. I actually just logged into the office. Yeah, I was notified by the system that you're online. That's why I call you so quickly. So what is the capital that you're looking towards investing at the moment? I don't know how many dollars it is. The minimum, the minimum required is $200. That's about $3,600. Yeah. Before when you were scanned, were you trading for yourself or they were doing it for you? How did that work? Actually, the way they set it out, they are going to put it. They made it so in other words, they were trading. They trading on might be off. That's a whole big problem. Yeah. When you give those people control over your capital, that is the problem because even if you're losing, you don't know what's going on. Yes, I am losing money. And most of the times, there's cameras. They just ask money from you and then they block you or they run away or sometimes they ask for money and then they say, okay, you've made the profit. But do we draw that profit? You got to pay more money. Yes. Have that happened to you? No, not so far as yet. But if money was supposed to be in the just a particular person or people, just a few. No problem in taking out the money. That's not happening. Yeah. When you're dealing with the legit company, even it's in our interest as a company to continue giving you reasons to trade because only when you trade on our platform, we are able to make a profit. Do you understand? My idea. If you never look in, if you never trade, we're not making any money and that's not good for the business. No, I'm observable. That's why they're giving you this account manager. That's why they are investing so much in you because if you continue trading with this for a long period, it's going to be good for the profit for the company. No, I'm not going to do that. And the poor thing. It means you're making profit as well. Are you at work now? I'm at work. I'm at work. Okay, okay. So what I'm is convenient to speak again. So I can help you start. Now one is I only, I don't know what time it is where you are, but yeah, after six, after six, then that when you're at home, it's when I'm at home. You work very long hours, my friend. What do you do? I'm in, it's really self-executive. That means stress to me. A lot of stress. Yeah, yeah, luckily for me, I'm not the company. I'm what it's not mainly the sales. It's more I'm on the procurement side now. Okay. So so chasing, chasing the targets and also it's not that's not so demanding. That's good. That's very good because you know, stress is a killer. That's what I do. Yeah, and yeah, and me, I'm I'm hybrid presence. I was 28 already. Thank you. So. Oh, I see you got to you got to you got to stay away from stress. Yeah, I think you have yourself. I like it. I'm just. I'm just. Really? I thought that you're younger than me. I'm 46. Your voice. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Even I'm going to call you after six because I'm going to stay later in the office today. I'm working South African time. So I will. Yeah, just with you at home. Thank you. The miss you're welcome. If you have any questions, just send me an email and I'll get back. No problem. I have a good day to it. Bye.
