# **Human–Machine Language Calibration Protocol (HMLCP)**
*Version 1.0 — Technical Specification*  
*Prepared for development and deployment teams*

---

## **1. Objective**

The **Human–Machine Language Calibration Protocol (HMLCP)** defines a structured process for adapting an AI or speech/NLP system to the **linguistic style, phrasing patterns, and communication behaviors of a specific human operator**.  
The purpose is to minimize semantic drift, interpretation latency, and misunderstanding — resulting in personalized machine understanding.

---

## **2. Core Principle**

Calibration ≠ model retraining.  
It is a *behavioral alignment process* that builds a **user-specific linguistic overlay (ULO)**, a layer of mapping rules and biases adapting the system’s interpretation pipeline to one individual.

User_Intent ≈ Machine_Interpretation(User_Input)

The deviation |Δ| is minimized through iterative feedback and adaptation.

---

## **3. Process Overview**

| Phase | Goal | Output |
|--------|------|--------|
| 1. Data Collection | Capture user-specific linguistic samples | Personal corpus |
| 2. Pattern Extraction | Analyze syntax, semantics, and tone | User language profile |
| 3. Interactive Calibration | Validate and correct understanding | Correction dataset |
| 4. Model Adaptation | Apply mappings and bias layers | Updated runtime profile |
| 5. Evaluation | Measure comprehension alignment | Calibration Index |

---

## **4. Phase 1 — Data Collection**

**Inputs:**
- **Speech:** 20–30 audio utterances (natural speech, 2–10 s each).  
- **Text:** 200–500 written sentences (commands, chat, email, etc.).

**Diversity:**
- Direct, indirect, domain-specific, and ambiguous phrasing.  
- Annotate each with intent and expected interpretation.

---

## **5. Phase 2 — Pattern Extraction**

Run NLP analysis (spaCy, fastText, etc.):

| Analyzer | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| Token frequency | Detect recurring lexical preferences |
| Dependency parsing | Identify sentence structure tendencies |
| Semantic clustering | Recognize topic domains |
| Prosody analysis | Identify rhythm, tone, pacing |
| Error mapping | Locate misunderstanding hotspots |

**Example Profile:**

User: sagiv.stavinsky
Tone: neutral–formal
Sentence length: 11.8 tokens
Directness: 72%
Ambiguity tolerance: 14%
Lexical bias: “check”, “align”, “verify”

---

## **6. Phase 3 — Interactive Calibration**

A live dialogue between human and system to iteratively improve understanding.

| Input | System Interpretation | Corrected Intent | Update |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------|--------|
| “Run TLP again.” | Open document TLP | Execute lead analysis | Add domain mapping |
| “Check Azure latency.” | Check weather | Query Azure metrics | Contextual bias |

---

## **7. Phase 4 — Model Adaptation**

### **a. Speech Layer**
Integrate user vocabulary with **Deepgram Custom Vocabulary API**.

### **b. NLP Layer**
Inject **User Linguistic Overlay (ULO)** with personalized mapping.

Example:
```json
{
  "user_id": "sagiv.stavinsky",
  "bias_terms": ["align", "TLP", "ProFacer"],
  "phrase_map": {
    "check": "retrieve",
    "run again": "re-execute",
    "align with": "synchronize"
  }
}

8. Phase 5 — Evaluation

Metric	Description	Ideal
Intent Match Rate (IMR)	% of correctly interpreted commands	≥95%
Correction Frequency	% requiring manual fix	≤5%
Semantic Drift	Cosine distance (intent vs interpretation)	≤0.15
Calibration Index	Weighted overall accuracy	≥0.9

    ↓
[User Linguistic Overlay (ULO)]
    ↓
[Intent Recognition / LLM]
    ↓
[Response Generation]

[TTS (ElevenLabs / Azure Speech)]

ULO acts as a dynamic layer translating human idiosyncrasies into model-standard semantics.

10. Ethical & Privacy Standards
	•	User consent required for language data collection.
	•	Option to delete calibration history (“forget me”).
	•	All logs pseudonymized; no raw audio stored.
	•	Voice and text profiles encrypted (AES-256).

⸻

11. Example Dialogue

User: Can you check that Azure thing?
System: Do you mean the App Service latency report?
User: Yes.
System: Mapping “check Azure thing” → “retrieve latency metrics.”

Later:

User: Check Azure thing.
System: Opening latency report.

✅ Demonstrates learned linguistic mapping.
