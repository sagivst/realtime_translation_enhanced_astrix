## Technical Achievements

### 1. Successfully Resolved Python Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: Coqui TTS requires Python ≤3.11, but Python 3.13 was installed
**Solution**: Installed Python 3.11.14 via Homebrew and created dedicated virtual environment
**Result**: All packages installed successfully

### 2. Implemented 5-Tier Queue Architecture
**Innovation**: Frame-level orchestration with precise 20ms granularity
**Benefit**: Predictable latency and better resource management
**Status**: Core logic implemented, awaiting service integration

### 3. Designed Dual-Embedding Voice System
**Approach**: ECAPA-TDNN (speaker) + GST-Tacotron (style) = 320-D vectors
**Benefit**: Superior voice cloning vs. cloud-based alternatives
**Status**: Infrastructure ready, embedding models require download

### 4. Created Local TTS Alternative
**Transition**: ElevenLabs cloud API → XTTS v2 local inference
**Latency Improvement**: ~500-1000ms → ~200-300ms (target)
**Cost Benefit**: No API quotas, unlimited usage
**Trade-off**: Requires GPU for production performance

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Asterisk Not Built Yet**
   - Status: Source downloaded but not compiled
   - Estimated time: 20-30 minutes
   - Blocker for: chan_externalmedia development

2. **XTTS Running on CPU**
   - Status: macOS doesn't support CUDA
   - Impact: Higher synthesis latency (~500ms vs ~200ms)
   - Workaround: Deploy on Linux with GPU for production

3. **ECAPA-TDNN Model Not Downloaded**
   - Status: Downloads automatically on first use
   - Impact: ~500MB download, 2-3 minutes
   - Workaround: Pre-download in production

4. **No Integration Tests**
   - Status: Core components not yet connected
   - Impact: Unknown if services integrate correctly
   - Next step: Create mock services for testing

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Asterisk build fails | Medium | High | Use Docker as fallback |
| XTTS latency too high | Medium | High | GPU deployment required |
| chan_externalmedia complexity | High | High | Incremental development, expert consultation |
| Integration issues | Medium | Medium | Early integration testing |
| Performance targets not met | Medium | High | Profile and optimize early |

## Decision Log

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Chose XTTS v2 over ElevenLabs**
   - Rationale: Lower latency, no API costs, unlimited usage
   - Trade-off: Requires local GPU, more complex setup
   - Status: ✅ Confirmed

2. **Chose Python 3.11 over 3.13**
   - Rationale: TTS library compatibility
   - Trade-off: Missing Python 3.13 features
   - Status: ✅ Confirmed

3. **Chose Dual Embeddings (ECAPA + GST)**
   - Rationale: Better voice cloning quality
   - Trade-off: Higher computational cost
   - Status: ✅ Confirmed

4. **Chose 20ms Frame Size**
   - Rationale: Balance between latency and processing overhead
   - Trade-off: More granular than typical 40-60ms
   - Status: ✅ Confirmed

5. **Chose 5-Tier Queue System**
   - Rationale: Clear separation of concerns, easier debugging
   - Trade-off: More complex than 2-3 tier
   - Status: ✅ Confirmed

## Team Notes

### For Future Developers

**Getting Started**:
1. Read `ASTERISK_SYSTEM_README.md` first
2. Review `GAP_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` for architecture understanding
3. Check `Realtime_Translation_Asterisk_DevSpec.md` for detailed specs
4. Run `test-xtts.py` to verify environment

**Development Tips**:
- XTTS first synthesis takes longer (model loading)
- Use `npm run dev` for hot-reload during development
- Check `logs/` directory for debugging
- Monitor queue sizes via metrics endpoint

**Common Commands**:
```bash
# Activate Python environment
cd xtts-server && source venv-xtts/bin/activate

# Test XTTS
python test-xtts.py

# Start XTTS inference server
python src/tts-service/xtts-inference-server.py --port 5001

# Start Node.js server
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Check Asterisk status
sudo asterisk -rx "core show channels"
```
