1. STATION 3: Before Deepgram API (line ~2331)
   Location: After wavAudio is created, before transcribeAudio()
   Emits: stationId, timestamp, extension, bufferSize, gainApplied

2. STATION 4: After Deepgram API (line ~2359)
   Location: After transcription received, before STAGE 3
   Emits: stationId, timestamp, extension, transcription, confidence, latency

3. STATION 9: Before Gateway (line ~2571)
   Location: In STAGE 9, after TTS audio is ready
   Emits: stationId, timestamp, extension, audioBufferSize, latencyStages

4. STATION 11: Before Hume API (line ~760)
   Location: In sendAudio function, before humeClient.sendAudio()
   Emits: stationId, timestamp, extension, chunkSize, humeConnected

SOCKET.IO EVENTS:
================

All 4 stations emit to: 'stationMetrics'

Event format:

  stationId: 'STATION-X',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  extension: extension/extensionId,
  ... station-specific data
}

TESTING:
========

1. Syntax check: PASSED ✓
2. Ready for integration with monitoring-server.js
3. Monitoring dashboard needs to listen for 'stationMetrics' events
