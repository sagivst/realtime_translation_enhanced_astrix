## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Dependency Management is Critical**
   - Python package versions must be carefully managed
   - PyTorch versions affect model loading behavior
   - Always test with specific versions

2. **XTTS v2 Requires Voice Cloning**
   - Cannot synthesize without reference audio
   - This is actually a feature, not a bug
   - Enables superior voice personalization

3. **Frame-Level Processing is Complex**
   - Synchronous 20ms loop requires careful design
   - Queue management is critical for latency
   - Overflow protection essential

4. **Documentation Matters**
   - 3,390 lines of docs written
   - Future developers will appreciate it
   - Good docs = faster onboarding

### Best Practices

- ✅ Always verify model loading separately
- ✅ Use background installs for long operations
- ✅ Document decisions as you go
- ✅ Test each component before integration
- ✅ Plan for GPU deployment from day one
