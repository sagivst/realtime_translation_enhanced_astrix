Last month, if you have the eating on the market with the gold, you have the chance close to 26,000 runs for one month, September. Here, we're investing only the minimum.

So in your case, not only in your case, you know, if you want to make a change and live like easier life, with less stress, you try. I'm gonna try. Absolutely.

Velislava_Chavdarova_00001.wav|Hello, Pondi. I am Dr. Prenor. How are you, Pondi? I am fine, ma'am. I am very well. Thank you. Did you receive the notification? Did the money reflect Pondi? No, that meant just to the little man. It was not my thing. I thought it was a little bit of a problem. I was just thinking about it. It was not my thing. It was not the payment. It was the 2000s. When we talked to him, he told us about the inflation. When are you going to have the 3500? No. Because I am really the 25th of this month. What do you expect? You know, there is a try to keep positive. Ask you the code. You know the code. What out? It says promotion code. Yes, that's good. Yes. The promotion code, I give it to you, Pondi. The promotion code is something that I give you from my system. Do you follow this? Yes, but it didn't give me. If you give me a very long time ago, because that is the one I gave you. I will put it in the 2000s. Well, I will be able to give you the promotion code, Pondi, once you have 3500. With 2000 runs, I cannot give you the promotion code. Do you understand me? Does the promotion code expire? The promotion code is different. The promotion code is different. For example, if you start today, Pondi, with 3500 runs, I managed to arrange for your welcome bonus of 100%. Meaning that you put 3500 from your site. I give you 3500 from my site. Total into the balance, you will have 7000 runs. This is the promotion code for today. This is what I prepared for you for this morning. Yes, now the problem is that you put little bit, little bit. And then maybe I don't know, promise us by the 25th of this month, okay? So you know to work someone, you don't have work, then you just... I'm giving you a favor because I have given you this work. Well, there is a new register after all, because you want to depend on yourself, and you want to be more stable financially, isn't it? Yes. Yes, right now you depend on this person who didn't pay you the full amount. You've got only 2000 runs. Yes, it's just 2000 runs. Well, this is the case you register it in the beginning, because you want to be more stable financially, and you want to have more money. Yes, but can't you maybe say, for instance, you just withdraw that bonus. I put this 2000 and then on the 25th I put the rest of the counter to that. No need, no need. If you put 2000 runs today, you cannot trade with this 2000 runs. The money will pay you... Yes? If I put it there, then I know it's there, then I chop up it. Well, you can do that. You can do that, but have in mind that this 2000 runs, you will not be able to use it until you top up to 3500. Okay, but if I'm trying to put it there, then... Today is not going to allow you today. This is something that we are going to do on Monday, because today is Saturday. This is an exception. I'm going to talk to my manager, but this is something we are going to do Monday for this 2000 runs. Oh, okay. No problem. All right. You don't need Monday, but what time should I give you a call, Pondi? When are you going to be available and online, of course? On Monday, actually, I'm off day on Monday. Okay, so I'm going to give you a call half past nine. But now the problem is, I'm afraid to call and borrow some money. You know you call and borrow some money, then you can't take it. Well, this is up to you, Pondi. I'm not going to tell you borrow or don't borrow. This is your decision. Yeah, but if I borrow then... Then you start trading. This is what happens then. Then you start trading. Well, then how long does it take, maybe two weeks, one month? So, for what to withdraw? Yeah, just if I can maybe get someone to borrow me the... the file. That is me. Right. Let me explain Pondi. If, for example, you deposit on Monday, you can contact with your account manager on Monday. And if you make a profit on Monday, even to use day, for example, you can make a withdrawal request, and then you can receive back the profits to the capital account. You don't need to wait two weeks or one month. As soon as you make a profit, this money is liquid Pondi. This money is available. If you make, for example, one thousand runs, the next day you can withdraw one thousand runs. If you make ten thousand runs as a potential profit, you can withdraw ten thousand runs. In Capitech, it will appear ten thousand runs. No. Yeah? You don't need to wait like... there is no time frame. Whenever you make a profit, this profit is liquid. The money is available. Okay. No, just, just talk on Monday. Maybe... on Monday I'll make a plan. Monday has... yes, I got you. Yeah, before you call me, maybe I'll tell you something different from today. Let us see Pondi. Let us see Monday morning half past nine I'm calling you. Okay. Half past nine? Half past nine, yes. Are you waiting me up for this? I'll just try to make some arrangements from now or not. You know this loan shark, you know, for now. If I go to the people, I say, hey, it's for me, maybe one thousand six hundred. And then you tell you a hundred runs, you must bring it back to... it must be one hundred and fifty. That's my problem, my God. Well, you decide Pondi. I know how is the story. This is your decision. How are you going to gather the investment capital Pondi? Okay. Yes. Yeah, but just call me Monday and then... Yes, I will. Yes, I will half past nine I'm calling you Pondi. Yes. I'll pass you. All right. Yes. Have a beautiful weekend Pondi. Thank you, man. I did, thank you. And bye-bye. Bye-bye. It's already raining here. There's no beautiful weekend. Hey! Tomorrow is going to be a sunny day. You put a smile on your face. It's going to make your day better. Yes, man. Okay. I'll... I'll... Yeah. We'll talk on Monday. We'll talk on Monday Pondi. Bye-bye. Bye.

Velislava_Chavdarova_00008.wav|Hello. Hey, Solo, finally found you. How are you? I'm okay, but I'm not good. One of my family member. Something happened. So, it didn't just call me now as you just call me from the GN. Aha. Yeah. So, what's going on now? I'm not okay. My mom is going to keep saying she already left. So, there's a funeral. I got you. But then my uncle says she's going to ring that. Next, because I told my mom everything. She said, fine. She's going to give me $2,000 and 12,000. So, she's going to be $5,000. I said, I'll deposit $4,000 because I need to go to that next. Just to make the trade a little bit higher. But for now, I'm going to withdraw this to this $200. Because my mom, my wife, for something and grocery and stuff, that's going to come back on Tuesday. Monday, Monday, I'm going to go to SARS. And I'm going to get my check number by Tuesday when my mom returns. I'm going to add them on and make it $4,000. I got you. I got you. Yes, ma'am. Because I'm not okay. I'm okay, but I'm not okay. I'm not a prominent number of my, just for a terrible accident. Well, sometimes, so long life is giving us... But this is... We cannot change. When we go. Even the lady just called, now she said, no, this is life. It's okay, you understand? It's okay, you're careful. You can die cheap. Mm-hmm. And you should never die this. I'm not a cheap entity. But by next week, I keep putting more than $3,400. And make it $4,000. I got you. I got you. However, so long since you didn't send the tax, you didn't make a full account. I'm not sure how fast that will be. Do you understand me? Yes. When you want to, we'll be drawn. Yes. I already made the list of the ideas. You did? Yes. You did. However, you didn't send a full package of documents. Yes. It's not going to be as fast as usual. Okay, so how many cases do you need to change? Three to five working days. Oh, okay. No. I'm going to change. Because now I'm an energy management. But by Monday, I want to go to start and get the information. Well, if you don't have the service, first of all, you can just an email to Nkova, that you don't have a tax number. You do an example. You don't repeat that again. If you don't have a tax number, you can just an email Nkova that you have a tax number due to an implosion, for example. Yes. If you, if you don't have a tax number, you can just an email. Just an email. Just a certain thing. Because you don't have a tax number. Hello. Do you hear me now, follow? Hello. Do you hear me now? Do you hear me? I can hear you. All right. I was saying that you can take care in the WhatsApp that you don't have a tax number. Do you follow me? Oh, in the WhatsApp. In the WhatsApp, you can send her a message that you don't have a tax number. Do you actually have a tax number? I do have a tax number. I have a tax number. I'm working this. Aha, you do have. Well, yes, then you need to take the tax number. For the further withdrawal to proceed. Not only? No, no. The withdrawal right now is here processing it. But in order to verify the outcome, do you understand me so low? So, I have to wait for Monday. So, what is the cost of my withdrawal to proceed? The withdrawal is proceeded. The outcome is here in 3-5 business days. Because your account without the tax number, because the account is still not verified so low. It's not verified. There is one missing document. This is the reason it's going to take longer. The understanding is so low. I think it is good to have been marked easier for you to provide the tax number so we can verify and approve the account. The full package of documents. Okay, no, no, I don't have a choice now. I have to wait for those things to pass. Now it's too big now. So, I don't know what you think. Well, I'll clean it before this article on Monday. Don't you have the chance to go to see how far it starts from you? It's very far, and I've been waiting for this. I got it. We are so lucky, I cannot help you on that, unfortunately. Again, you find it at home. Don't you have a picture of the number? Don't you have something? No, I don't have anything. Because when they press leave, it's not the check number. It's a V18 number. It's a V18. I have to renew my exchange. They have the old four numbers. I could have done it online, but they have the old four numbers. They have to go to sorry. Yes, exactly. Okay, well, you've seen the tax number as soon as you get it. I'll just wait for those eight to two points. I have no choice. I'm a no. On Monday, you go to start. You don't need to wait five days. So, they will probably going to change five days. So, I said three to five, not five days. Between three and five days. Yes, the money it might appear on your site on Monday. Because Monday is going to be the third day. Yes, the third day you may request. Meaning, Thursday, Friday, Monday is the third day. Do you follow me? Okay, no, no, I understand. Okay, meanwhile, on Gold to Stars, you're going to need the tax number anyway. You're just asking. Exactly. It doesn't matter if you receive the funds on Monday or on Tuesday. The tax number is needed. So, once you receive the funds, then you deposit it again. The account will be ready for you to start trading. You will not wait for more time solo. Because I will be under the tax number itself. Exactly. Do you understand me now what is the idea? Though with Roppel, it's taking three to five business days. Meanwhile, you take the tax number so you can verify the account with a full package of documents. Then you are ready to go then. Okay, wonderful. You got the travel on the file that we are speaking on the same page now. Okay, no. Thank you very much. Let me just prepare for a competition. I, okay, follow. I, the pipeline. Anything you can aim at. Thank you very much. I will. Okay, bye. Have a nice day. You to solo.
